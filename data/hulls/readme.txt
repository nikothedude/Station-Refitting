SR_stationModules adds the ship to the registry of ships that need to have OP autogenerated.
OP is generated by finding the maximum OP spent in any of its pre-defined variants, and multiplying it against a small constant.

SR_stationOP *forces* OP to be whatever is entered.

Both can be overridden/appended by mods.
